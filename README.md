Question 2 
This question is based on the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. You are going to 
add deferent Food items (Rice, Dahl, Soya) in deferent quantities of kilograms. Quantities are 
passed through the constructor. 
Part a) You can refer the output is given in FoodDemo class and adjust your code accordingly 
i). First implement the IAccountable interface and declare void calculateCost( ) method. 
ii). Then implement and Item abstract class and declare the methods with return types 
displayltem( ):String,   getCost( ): double, getQuantity( ):double 
iii). Create concrete classes called Rice, Soya and Dahl and override all abstract methods 
displayItem(), getCost() and getQuality() . 
iv). Add the property qtylnKilos and overload the constructor of each class (Rice, Soya and Dahl) 
and use the data type double. 
v). Similarly create a class called Food and implement the !Accountable interface with in the class 
and override the calculateCost() method. Then overload the constructor to pass the array of 
Items (E.g. :- Item [ ]). 
Part b) Food class should calculate the cost in each item and it should print the sub total of each 
order I ine and at the end it should print the total cost. 
i). When calculate the line total it should multiply each itemÂ· s cost with the given 
quantity and use iteration to print item name. cost, quantity and the line total as per the console 
output.
